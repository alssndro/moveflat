There is plenty of space in the house with 4 levels - one is a large modern kitchen and dining area, one has a spacious living area with 2 terraces on each side, the other 2 levels are with bedrooms and bathrooms. We are located along Regent's Canal where we have an outdoor dinging/bbq area. We also have a garage area which accommodates laundry, bicycles etc. The location is exceptional with Regent's Park, Primrose Hill shops& pubs, Camden market and Chalk Farm/Camden tube within a short walk. We are also 5 minutes walk from Morrison's supermarket, or Wholefoods in Camden. We are 3 professional women from France, Ireland and Australia. We're travelling very often but it is also a friendly and warm houseshare, we often share dinner and would like someone like-minded. Please drop us an email to arrange a viewing or for more information. Thanks!")
